# CorigineAssignment
## Description
This program takes a single integer argument and computes its factorial. It then computes the sum of the digits of the factorial, finally providing this as an output.

This program was designed using _python3_ and includes the _sys_ library. It was developed to run in a Docker container.

## Files
    1. main.py          - python file containing the code
    2. Dockerfile       - creates Docker container
    3. requirements.txt - contains dependencies required

## Installation
    1. Clone the repo: 
        $ git clone https://github.com/NiravSurajlal/CorigineAssignment.git
    2. Navigate to the project folder:
        $ cd <path>/CorigineAssignment
    3. Build the Docker container:
        $ docker build -t factorial-digits .
    4. Run the program using an integer input for N:
        $ docker run -it factorial-digits N

## Example Usage
For a given positive integer **N**, the code calculates N! and then the sum of that answer. The results are displayed in the command line. 

    $ docker run --rm factorial-digits 10
    27
    $ docker run --rm factorial-digits 100
    648
